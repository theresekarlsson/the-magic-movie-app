# the-magic-movie-app

Android-app för att söka efter filmer. 
Laborationsuppgift från kurs på Karlstad universitet.

Requirements:
You need to develop an Android e-service app that helps movie intested people finding new movies that may suite them. 
The app should let the user enter a (part of) a movie title, the app should provide the user a list of suggestions for the movie title. 
The user should be able to choose one suggestion and then get at least 10 movies that are similar (or the maximum amount the service allows). 
You can use the movie service called Rotten Tomatoes, they provide an API that may be useful. 
The user should be able to select a movie in the list and add it to a locally persisted shortlist. 
The shortlist needs to be accessible from the GUI. This means that the user can add a movie he/she finds interesting to 
the shortlist and then later on retrieve it from there.
